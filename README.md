Below we have links to some different labs as well as challenges.
The difference between these two, are that the labs will guide you through creating the app using CoPilot, while a challenge doesn't.

Labs:
If you want something super simple that holds your hand as you go for the first lab: https://github.com/es-copilot-ldn/csharp-simple-demo - This is **VERY** basic

Beginner level Lab: Minimal WebAPI

Challenges:
If you want a challenge with a theme(These are all fantasical/fantasy themes) that tries to gamify it a little: https://github.com/microsoft/copilotadventures?tab=readme-ov-file#choose-your-own-copilot-adventure - This is challenge mode, so dictation of end result but not how you get there
